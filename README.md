# Student_lifestyle_dataset

Hi,

As part of my data science journey, I have taken a dataset that contain students academic performance and student well-being. The goal is to build a supervised learning model to predict the stress level of the students based on their academic performance and student well-being.

This dataset consist of 8 columns which represent each student academic and well-being records.

Stress_Level : This column gives us the stress level that the student us experiencing currently.

# Dependent column vs independent column:

**Independent column/variable:** The variable that are not affected by the other variables are called independent variables. These variables/column influences on the decision or the outcome of the dependent column.  The independent columns in 
                                  this dataset are (Student_ID, Study_Hours_Per_Day, Extracurricular_Hours_Per_Day, Sleep_Hours_Per_Day, Social_Hours_Per_Day, Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day, GPA)

**Dependent column/variable:** The variable that are affected by the other variables are called dependent variables. These variables/column gets influenced by the decision or the outcome of the independent column.  The dependent columns in 
                                  this dataset are (Stress_Level)
